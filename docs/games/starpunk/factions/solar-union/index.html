    <main>
      <p>An authoritarian republic.</p>
      <p>Comprises: Earth, Luna, Mars, and some extra-solar settlements.</p>
      <p>Nationalist hierarchy: Earth &gt; Luna &gt; Mars.</p>
      <p>Extra-solar people and cultures viewed as enemy.</p>
      <p>
        Society is mobilized for war. Political, civil, and economic freedoms
        curtailed in the interests of national cohesion.
      </p>
      <h2>Ideology</h2>
      <p>
        Union policy states that the cause of the breakdown is native population
        growth in Arcadia and Gaia causing a disconnect in the national identity
        of union citizens.
      </p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Since the breakdown, the union has adopted various policies intended to
        enhance national cohesion and reinforce the solar identity and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system of chartered territories has been abolished. Franchises and
        protectorates have been replaced with governates, overseen by
        republic-appointed governers with a mandate to ensure efforts are
        directed towards the interests of the republic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cantonments are under martial law, with non-military residents relocated
        to principals or governates. The SPSF has merged with planetside armed
        forces to form the Solar Defence Forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The union&#39;s focus is on reforming the Solar Union by regaining
        control of Arcadia, Gaia, and the former chartered territories - and
        securing the union&#39;s peaceful future by purging what it describes as
        &quot;anti-Solar&quot; elements.
