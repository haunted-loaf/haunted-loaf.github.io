    <main>
      <p>A progressive confederation.</p>
      <p>Compromises: Gaia, Elysia, and many other settlements.</p>
      <p>
        Established after rebellions on Gaia, a semi-lawless frontier garden
        world, and Elysia, a corporate farm world.
      </p>
      <p>
        A foundation of both individual freedom and communal responsibility
        creates tension.
      </p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Gaia</h3>
      <p>
        Gaia is a farm world, initially settled as a protectorate. Union surveys
        did not reveal the extent of its habitability. While it was known to
        have a breathable atmosphere and comfortable temperatures across much of
        its surface, early settlers found that the soil was exceptionally
        fertile, and Earth crops could grow on Gaia without extensive work to
        prepare the farmland.
      </p>
      <p>
        On previously discovered habitable worlds, the soil was either sterile,
        or already colonised by alien microbial life which couldn&#39;t break
        down Earth&#39;s plant residues left over after harvesting - making
        sustainable agriculture impossible until the soil could be re-colonised
        by Earth organisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        A side-effect of Gaia&#39;s unexpected fecundity was a population
        explosion which, initially, went unnoticed by the union. On most worlds,
        new settlers immigrating from Earth greatly outnumbered native
        residents, but on Gaia it was the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, as the union sent officials and chartered companies to
        expand their operations on Gaia, they began to be viewed as unwelcome
        invaders colonising the native Gaians. This eventually culminated in
        Gaia secceeding from the union, which set of a chain reaction of other
        seccessions, and the breakdown.
