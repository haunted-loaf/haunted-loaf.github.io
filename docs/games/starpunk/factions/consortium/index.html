    <main>
      <p>A neo-feudal plutocratic formation.</p>
      <p>Comprises: Arcadia, and many corporate character settlements.</p>
      <p>
        Established by large extra-solar corporations for mutual defense against
        republic policies of seizing corporate assets in national interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deals with inter-corporation trade and mutual defense. Other matters
        left to individual proprietors to decide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The consortium&#39;s focus is on maintaining its independence, and
        growing its economic base.
      </p>
      <h2>Formation</h2>
      <p>
        After the republic started to seize franchise assets, the directors of a
        number of franchise-and-concession-holding corporations convened the
        franchise forum on Arcadia. In possession of large parts of the
        union&#39;s navy and economic backbone, these corporations are in a
        position to declare and defend their independence.
      </p>
      <h2>Governance</h2>
      <p>
        The consortium&#39;s ruling body, the forum, operates a shareholder
        system, where each member has voting power according to how many forum
        shares it holds. It is possible for individuals to become forum members,
        but shares are very expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The members are generally free to run their affairs as they wish. The
        forum is chiefly concerned with mediating disputes, enabling cooperation
        between members, and, most importantly, supporting mutual defence
        against enemies of corporate rule.
      </p>
      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <p>
        Cut off from the fiscal and monetary agencies of the union, now in
        republic hands, consortium members at first took to paying their workers
        in scrip (private currencies issued by companies and only redeemable
        with the issuer). Since most franchises were already operated as company
        towns, this was easy enough to achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The consortium now issues its own credits, but these are limited to
        intercorporate trade and wealth individuals: most workers are still paid
        in scrip.
