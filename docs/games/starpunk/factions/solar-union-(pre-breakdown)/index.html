    <main>
      <p>
        A solar empire with trappings of liberal democracy. Not dissimilar to
        1600s British Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comprises: Earth, Luna, Mars, Arcadia, and many extra-solar settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extra-solar settlements set up under union charters, either military,
        corporate, or community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pre-breakdown state. A confederation of Earth, Luna, Mars, Arcadia,
        and many smaller territories. The small territories were represented in
        the union by one of the five principal members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The union&#39;s military, the Solar Peace and Security Force, served
        peacekeeping and police functions, primarily concerned with addressing
        smuggling and small- scale piracy. While principal members retained
        traditional armed forces, only the SPSF was authorized to operate a
        space force.
      </p>
      <h2>Territories</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from the principal members, the union had three kinds of
        <em>chartered territories</em>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Franchises, administered by a corporation;</li>
        <li>Protectorates, self-administered by their residents; and</li>
        <li>Cantonments, military bases under SPSF jurisdiction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Franchises were established under a union charter sponsored by a
        principal member. They typically ran as company towns, with the owning
        corporation providing everything residents needed to live. The charters
        granted corporations exclusive rights to provide certain goods and
        services within the franchise, so residents either had to work for the
        corporation or carefully avoid competing with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protectorates could be established by private individuals or groups.
        While no law prohibited establishing independent settlements outside
        union jurisdiction, becoming a protectorate granted valuable benefits
        like SPSF protection and access to union finance and aid programs.
        Enrolment as a protectorate required a principal sponsor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cantonments were established by the union for exclusive SPSF use. They
        served as garrisons, ship yards, and naval bases. By law, the production
        and assembly of items dedicated to SPSF use was carried on inside
        cantonments, although these operations were contracted out to
        corporations under <em>concessionaire agreements</em> similar to
        franchises. Although operated by and for the military, outside of
        military matters, the cantonments were under civil governance.
      </p>
      <h2>Governance</h2>
      <p>
        The government of the union consisted of a directly-elected parliament
        and a council of the governments of each member state. Union law had to
        be approved by both the parliament and council to come into force. While
        each member was responsible for implementing union law in its own
        territory, a Solar Commission provided governance and administration for
        inter-state elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Solar Union technically had no head of state, although the council
        had a president who was often treated as such. Similarly, the high
        commissioner of the solar commission was often regarded as the head of
        government.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solar judiciary consisted of the court of justice, which heard cases
        between member states, and the court of appeals, which heard cases
        between individuals and member states.
      </p>
      <p>
        The union&#39;s military, the Solar Peace and Security Force, served
        peacekeeping and police functions, primarily concerned with addressing
        smuggling and small- scale piracy. However, while member states were
        permitted traditional armed forces, only the SPSF was authorized to
        operate a space navy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Member states could secede from the union. If a non-member settlement
        wished to secede, it would first have to become a member, which would be
        challenging.
