      <p>An alliance of free worlds.</p>
      <p>
        Comprises: Tartarus (former military settlement), and many other
        settlements.

      <p>
        The cost of membership is contributing to the upkeep of the League Navy,
        and the benefit of membership is receiving the protection of the League
        Navy.

      <h2>Formation</h2>
      <p>
        Many of the member states of the union sought true independence, and had
        no interest in escaping the union only to subordinate themselves to yet
        another government on some other planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        While many worlds tried to go it alone in the immediate aftermath of the
        breakdown, they quickly found that defending themselves against the
        other remnants of the union was no easy task.
      </p>
      <p>
        The League of Worlds was formed to provide mutual defense and support
        for these independent worlds, allowing them to pool resources and share
        the burden of defense.
