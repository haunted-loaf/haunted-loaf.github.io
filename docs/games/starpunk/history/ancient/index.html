      <h2>Panspermia</h2>
      <p>
        Billions of years ago, life arose on an unidentified world. A presumably
        catastrophic event sent fragments of rock containing primitive lifeforms
        out of the world&#39;s star system and into the galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature of the seed, the &quot;progenote&quot;, isn&#39;t precisely
        known, but it is known that it was a kind of ribocyte - a single-celled
        organism with no persistent internal structures using RNA to encode
        genetic data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same progenotes seeded life on many other worlds in the galactic
        neighbourhood. It is believed that in most cases, life did not survive
        very long, but on some worlds the seed took root and life survives to
        the present day.
      </p>
      <h3>Alternative theories</h3>
      <p>
        Some believe the seed was not spread randomly after being ejected from
        its host system, but intentionally spread by space-faring aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some believe that panspermia did not occur, and the recurrence of
        RNA-based life is simply a result of convergent evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some believe that life was seeded on each planet by a deity. Most
        notable for holding this belief are the Mormons, who also maintain that
        we will eventually find planets with humanoid life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some believe that extraterrestrial life is a deception being perpetuated
        for mysterious reasons. These people generally believe that life
        currently exists on other worlds, but maintain that it was introduced
        recently by humans.
      </p>
      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Around 4 billion years ago, the progenote arrived on Earth and seeded
        life there.
