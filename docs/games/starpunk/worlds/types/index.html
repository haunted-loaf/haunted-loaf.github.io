    <main>
      <h2>Useless</h2>
      <h2>Exploitable</h2>
      <p>These worlds contain economically viable mineral deposits.</p>
      <h2>Prebiotic</h2>
      <p>
        These worlds have an atmosphere with carbon dioxide but no oxygen, and
        liquid water oceans with many dissolved minerals. They do not contain
        life, but conditions are suitable for the survival of progenotes if they
        are introduced.
      </p>
      <h2>Archaeobiotic</h2>
      <p>
        Worlds which have been colonised by progenotes, but life has not evolved
        to the point where it metabolises oxygen for energy. On most such
        worlds, life is still ocean-bound and single-celled.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is great diversity in the forms life has taken, and it is uncommon
        for it to be biocompatible with Earth life. In particular, alien life is
        rarely edible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a handful of worlds in which the biochemistry is compatible
        enough that humans can eat it, although it usually requires processing
        to be palatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        These worlds still have little or no oxygen in their atmospheres, which
        limits their potential for human settlement: both humans and crops need
        oxygen to live.
      </p>
      <h2>Abiooxygenic</h2>
      <p>
        Lifeless worlds with atmospheric oxygen which arises from non-biological
        sources, typically surface deposits of titanium-oxide being struck by
        lightning or high-energy solar particles.
      </p>
      <p>
        These worlds may be comfortable for humans to exist on without sealed
        suits or habitats, which makes them attractive for settlement.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, their sterile regolith is poses problems for long-term
        cultivation of Earth crops, and a constant supply of fertilizer must be
        imported or produced locally to support long-term habitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This limitation also has some benefits, as crops grown in this
        environment are very effectively protected against disease and rot.
      </p>
      <h2>Biooxygenic</h2>
      <p>
        A world with atmospheric oxygen arising from biological sources -
        suitably evolved forms of progenotes.
      </p>
      <p>
        On these worlds, there are often simple multicellular organisms like
        kelp. It is widely assumed that there are worlds with more complex life
        comparable to animals, but none have been found.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, life has colonised the land, in forms at least visually similar
        to algal blooms, microbial mats, slimes, simple fungi, or moss.
      </p>
      <p>
        On all oxygenic worlds other than Gaia, crop cultivation is hampered
        either by the lack or presence of life on land. In the absence of life
        on land, the regolith is sterile and the same issues as abiooxygenic
        worlds arise. In the presence of life, it is not usually able to
        decompose crop residues <em>and</em> may contaminate the crops
        themselves.
      </p>
      <h2>Gaian</h2>
      <p>
        A classification of world made only after the discovery of Gaia, a
        biooxygenic world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worlds of this type, of which Gaia is the only known example, are home
        to life with a biochemistry highly compatible with that of Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of Gaia&#39;s soil contains organisms which can decompose crop
        residues into the nutrients those crops need to grow. This makes
        long-term cultivation feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combined with the absence of complex life in the form of pests that
        would eat or infest the crops, this renders Gaia uniquely hospitable -
        in some ways even more hospitable than Earth.
