      <h2>Geological</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike our Earth, this alternative Earth formed with very few
        radioactive elements in its crust. Events otherwise continued mostly as
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of radioactive elements limits subterranean heating, which is a
        significant catalyst in the formation of fossil fuels. Without this heat
        source, fossil fuels are very slow to form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coal, gas, and oil were known since antiquity, but are too rare to serve
        as an industrial society&#39;s fuel source. They serve as curiosities
        and precursors to certain luxury goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Earth did not have a Carboniferous era, since the name refers to
        the large coal deposits which originate from this time. On this Earth
        the corresponding era is the Riphean, after the mythical Riphean
        mountains which are sometimes identified with the Urals.
      </p>
      <h2>Industrial revolution</h2>
      <p>
        In 1763, the Seven Year War ended. During the war, the parties had
        developed their logistical infrastructure on land and sea, and the
        manpower and infrastructure was now available to be repurposed towards
        industrialisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The industrial revolution was powered by wood and charcoal. Europe had
        been mostly deforested long ago. The supplies of wood needed to power
        industry first came from British America, Brazil, and the Russian
        Empire.
      </p>
      <h2>Colonialism</h2>
      <p>
        The British retained their holdings in the North-East Americas, whose
        vast forests were tremendously important to Britain&#39;s industrial
        development. As Britain became increasingly dependent on British
        American wood, the colonies gained increasing political and economic
        power in the empire. Spain retained its Western-American holdings.
      </p>
      <p>
        To provide a buffer against the Spanish, Britain allowed various
        indigenous tribes to hold territory in the Appalachia, favouring
        particularly the Six Nations. In the far North, however, Britain crushed
        the natives, many of whom had sided with the French in the war.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ottomans, mostly locked out of the new world, instead moved south
        into the Africa, towards the forests of . For about a century, they were
        the only colonial power to show any interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1890, the colonial powers have expanded into the far east, starting
        with India, and eventually the so-called East Indies.
      </p>
      <h2>Airships</h2>
      <p>
        Airships were developed in the late 19th century. Henri Giffard designed
        the first steam-powered airship in 1870.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, Solomon Andrews would develop the first modern aereon design: an
        aircraft with wings which provide lift as long as the aircraft is in
        motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This limitation is balanced by the increased range and speed of these
        aereons, and the ability to shrink the balloon down, since it no longer
        needs to provide as much lift. This makes the airship a smaller target,
        an important feature in war.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, an airship&#39;s designer may make use of the extra
        lifting capability to keep the balloon as it is, but add heavy armour,
        producing the ironclad airship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest development in airships are rotastats, airships with rotors
        able, like conventional dirigibles, to hover on the spot, but also to
        have the improved performance characteristics of an aereon.
      </p>
      <h2>Wingships</h2>
      <p>
        Another kind of aircraft is the wingship, powered by a &quot;ready
        motor&quot;, a kind of engine which burns wood gas and from that drives
        a rotating shaft directly, rather than through a steam boiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ready motors can be much lighter than steam engines. Wings along could
        not lift a steam airship, but they can lift a wingship with a light
        ready motor in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wood gas is hard to store and transport around compared to wood, and
        tends to leak out of containers, so it is usually extracted from wood in
        small quantities near the place they are used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Larger airships may carry a small retinue of winghships, and will have a
        &quot;gasifier&quot; on board to generate their fuel from their wood
        supplies. Wingships have impressive capabilities, but they are short
        range vehicles, with flight times limited to several minutes between
        fueling.
      </p>
      <h2>Malaysian Theatre</h2>
      <p>
        The game begins in 1890. The Dutch and the British are in conflict over
        control of the Malay archipelago. The conflict sparks into war over the
        island of Borneo, pulling in the local great powers of New Spain in the
        Philippines, and French Indochina.
