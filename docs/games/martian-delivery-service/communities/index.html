      <h2>Tubers</h2>
      <p>
        The surface of Mars is crossed by many lava tubes, left behind by
        ancient volcanic activity. Unlike lava tubes on Earth, these tubes can
        be exceedingly large, with some being several kilometers wide and
        hundreds of kilometers long.
      </p>
      <p>
        With their openings sealed and pumped with breathable air, suitable lava
        tubes can be converted into habitats for a fraction of the cost of an
        equivalent space on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        A habitable lava tube is naturally shielded from radiation, and has a
        stable temperature and pressure: making it an ideal place to live and
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes a lot of work to convert a lava tube into a habitat, and tubes
        must be carefully selected, because if a tube collapses, the
        consequences can be disasterous. A geologically stable and
        well-maintained tube, however, is one of the safest places on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The residents of habitable tubes are called Tubers. They are amongst the
        most prestigious communities on Mars. Tubes are centers of tourism and
        administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single tube can house thousands of people, and as long as there is
        more tube, the habitable area can be expanded relatively cheaply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every tube has a different political makeup, but larger and more
        established tubes tend to favour local governance, both within the tube
        and for Mars more generally.
      </p>
      <h2>Domers</h2>
      <p>
        The Martian domes are the largest settlements on the Martian surface.
        They are inflatable domed habitats that provide an Earth-like
        environment for their inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to their great expense, domes are primarily built by wealthy
        corporations to house their workers, who are mostly Earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domers mostly perform factory work, research, and administration.
        Extractive labour is typically outsourced to the resettled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domes are quick to build and relatively cheap, but they cannot be
        expanded as easily as tubes or camps, which can leave to overcrowding.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, Domers are Earthers who view Mars as a workplace, and Earth
        as their home. They tend to oppose home rule for Mars.
      </p>
      <h2>Resettled</h2>
      <p>
        The Resettled are those transported to Mars as part of a program
        designed to address hyperunderemployment on Earth by sending people to
        Luna and Mars. It is technically voluntary, although for most the other
        option is languishing in poverty on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most resettled people live in surface-based resettlement camps,
        typically working in mining and fuel production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resettlement camps consist of many small habitats which open onto the
        Martian atmosphere. They are very quick to assemble and cheap and easy
        to expand. However, they are not convenient places to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resettled might not view Mars as their home, but they usually have a
        poor opinion of Earth, and support Martian home rule. They may lack the
        fierce independence of homesteaders, and instead support a strong
        centralised state.
      </p>
      <h2>Homesteaders</h2>
      <p>
        A homestead is a small, self-sufficient habitat - typically on the
        Martian surface. It typically consists of residential space, a
        greenhouse, and a solar array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual homesteads are self-sufficient in the basic needs, but rely
        on trade with other homesteads and settlements for things they can&#39;t
        produce themselves, such as medicines or electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the current resettlement program, there was a short-lived
        homesteading program where the resettled were given sufficient resources
        and training to establish themselves. Some homesteaders are descendants
        of those original settlers, while others originate in other communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Homesteaders value their independence and are opposed to centralised
        control, but they also value community, particularly with other
        homesteaders or those they view as fellow travellers. Homesteaders often
        form ad-hoc alliances for cooperation and trade, or for other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, homesteaders are not homogeneous. Some homesteaders are just
        born into it, or forced into it by circumstance, and have no ideological
        commitment to the life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still other homesteaders pursue isolation and self-sufficiency not as a
        goal in itself, but a necessary step towards some other goal - often the
        formation of a new community along religious or philosophical grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        One goal of the initial homesteading program was to experiment with
        different ways of living on Mars in the so-called Thousand Flowers
        Campaign. Only a dozen communities were established before the program
        was cancelled. These communities and their descendants, now often known
        as Thousands, are amongst the more eccentric Martians.
