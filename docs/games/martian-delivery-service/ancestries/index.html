      <h2>Earthers</h2>
      <p>
        Some are on Mars for work, some for pleasure, some out of necessitity.
        They regard Earth as their home, and Mars as somewhere they happen to
        be.
      </p>
      <h2>Martians</h2>
      <p>
        Most Martians were born on Mars, or have lived there for decades. Some
        believe only native-born Martians are true Martians, while others
        believe anyone can claim Mars as their home.
      </p>
      <h2>Lunars</h2>
      <p>
        People from the Moon. The Moon&#39;s proximity and dependence on Earth
        enables Earth to keep it on a tight leash. Many Martians view Lunars as
        essentially equivalent to Earthers, while Earthers often position Lunars
        as model extraterrestrial citizens, and compare Martians unfavourably
        with them.
