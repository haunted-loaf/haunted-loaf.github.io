      <p>
        One thing I love in game design is designing what I call &quot;tactical
        horizons&quot; - I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s another name for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#39;s the length, in time, that a gameplay decision affects the game.
        For example, in a game with regenerating health, the tactical horizon of
        taking damage extends until your health regenerates. In other games it
        might extend to finding potions, reaching a bonfire, or finishing the
        level. I think a good game has overlapping tactical horizons.
      </p>
      <p>Some concrete examples from Death Stranding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When moving with your delivery in the world, you decide whether to
            walk or run. Running is faster, but requires extra gameplay to stay
            balanced. You can very quickly change your pace, so the horizon for
            this is in the seconds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You also choose where to go. If you go over rough terrain,
            you&#39;re more likely to fall over, but it may be a slightly faster
            route. The horizon for this may be tens of seconds or more.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You can choose the route more generally. There may be a direct route
            which takes you through enemy territory, but a longer, safer, route.
            The horizon is several minutes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Before you start on a delivery, you decide how much stuff to take
            with you. If you overload yourself, it&#39;s more challenging to
            make the delivery, but you progress the game faster. This horizon
            might even extend for hours.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You can choose to put resources into building roads, vehicles, or
            other ways to traverse the world more easily. Those resources are
            then unavailable for other improvements, and you had to expend time
            moving those resources around. The horizon could extend over
            multiple play sessions, even the entire game.
