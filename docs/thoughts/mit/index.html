    <h1 class="keep">MIT license misunderstanding</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        There is an incredibly common misunderstanding of the MIT license as
        permitting one to take MIT licensed code and just relicense it under
        different terms. This is <em>not meaningfully true</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>original</em> license applies to &quot;any person obtaining a
        copy of the Software&quot;. This means that without any action on your
        part, if you distribute MIT-licensed software to other people, the
        original license is <em>automatically</em> extended to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The attribution clause not only gives credit, but gives the recipient
        notice that the MIT license applied to some of the software they
        received.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who receive the combine code from me are authorised to modify or
        distribute whatever MIT-licensed code remains, if they can unravel it
        from the whole.
      </p>
