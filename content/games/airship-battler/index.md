# Airship Battler

A game about airships fighting.

Set in a steampunk alternative history where fossil fuels
don't exist. Without oil the internal combustion engine was
not developed until much later, and remains a curiosity.

Airships are steam powered and burn wood. They are the most
effective way to move across unknown, hostile, or dry
terrain.

Steamships remain effective on the ocean and large rivers,
but are not the subject of the game. (Probably.)
