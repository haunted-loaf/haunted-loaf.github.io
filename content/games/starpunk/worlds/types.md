# Types of Worlds

## Useless

## Exploitable

These worlds contain economically viable mineral deposits.

## Prebiotic

These worlds have an atmosphere with carbon dioxide but no oxygen, and liquid water oceans with many dissolved minerals. They do not contain life, but conditions are suitable for the survival of progenotes if they are introduced.

## Archaeobiotic

Worlds which have been colonised by progenotes, but life has not evolved to the point where it metabolises oxygen for energy. On most such worlds, life is still ocean-bound and single-celled.

There is great diversity in the forms life has taken, and it is uncommon for it to be biocompatible with Earth life. In particular, alien life is rarely edible.

There are a handful of worlds in which the biochemistry is compatible enough that humans can eat it, although it usually requires processing to be palatable.

These worlds still have little or no oxygen in their atmospheres, which limits their potential for human settlement: both humans and crops need oxygen to live.

## Abiooxygenic

Lifeless worlds with atmospheric oxygen which arises from non-biological sources, typically surface deposits of titanium-oxide being struck by lightning or high-energy solar particles.

These worlds may be comfortable for humans to exist on without sealed suits or habitats, which makes them attractive for settlement.

However, their sterile regolith is poses problems for long-term cultivation of Earth crops, and a constant supply of fertilizer must be imported or produced locally to support long-term habitation.

This limitation also has some benefits, as crops grown in this environment are very effectively protected against disease and rot.

## Biooxygenic

A world with atmospheric oxygen arising from biological sources - suitably evolved forms of progenotes.

On these worlds, there are often simple multicellular organisms like kelp. It is widely assumed that there are worlds with more complex life comparable to animals, but none have been found.

Often, life has colonised the land, in forms at least visually similar to algal blooms, microbial mats, slimes, simple fungi, or moss.

On all oxygenic worlds other than Gaia, crop cultivation is hampered either by the lack or presence of life on land. In the absence of life on land, the regolith is sterile and the same issues as abiooxygenic worlds arise. In the presence of life, it is not usually able to decompose crop residues _and_ may contaminate the crops themselves.

## Gaian

A classification of world made only after the discovery of Gaia, a biooxygenic world.

Worlds of this type, of which Gaia is the only known example, are home to life with a biochemistry highly compatible with that of Earth.

Much of Gaia's soil contains organisms which can decompose crop residues into the nutrients those crops need to grow. This makes long-term cultivation feasible.

Combined with the absence of complex life in the form of pests that would eat or infest the crops, this renders Gaia uniquely hospitable - in some ways even more hospitable than Earth.
