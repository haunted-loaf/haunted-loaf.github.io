# The Consortium

A neo-feudal plutocratic formation.

Comprises: Arcadia, and many corporate character settlements.

Established by large extra-solar corporations for mutual defense against republic policies of seizing corporate assets in national interests.

Deals with inter-corporation trade and mutual defense. Other matters left to individual proprietors to decide.

The consortium's focus is on maintaining its independence, and growing its economic base.

## Formation

After the republic started to seize franchise assets, the directors of a number of franchise-and-concession-holding corporations convened the franchise forum on Arcadia. In possession of large parts of the union's navy and economic backbone, these corporations are in a position to declare and defend their independence.

## Governance

The consortium's ruling body, the forum, operates a shareholder system, where each member has voting power according to how many forum shares it holds. It is possible for individuals to become forum members, but shares are very expensive.

The members are generally free to run their affairs as they wish. The forum is chiefly concerned with mediating disputes, enabling cooperation between members, and, most importantly, supporting mutual defence against enemies of corporate rule.

## Economy

Cut off from the fiscal and monetary agencies of the union, now in republic hands, consortium members at first took to paying their workers in scrip (private currencies issued by companies and only redeemable with the issuer). Since most franchises were already operated as company towns, this was easy enough to achieve.

The consortium now issues its own credits, but these are limited to intercorporate trade and wealth individuals: most workers are still paid in scrip.
