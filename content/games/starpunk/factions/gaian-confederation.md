# Gaian Confederation

A progressive confederation.

Compromises: Gaia, Elysia, and many other settlements.

Established after rebellions on Gaia, a semi-lawless frontier garden world, and Elysia, a corporate farm world.

A foundation of both individual freedom and communal responsibility creates tension.

## History

### Gaia

Gaia is a farm world, initially settled as a protectorate. Union surveys did not reveal the extent of its habitability. While it was known to have a breathable atmosphere and comfortable temperatures across much of its surface, early settlers found that the soil was exceptionally fertile, and Earth crops could grow on Gaia without extensive work to prepare the farmland.

On previously discovered habitable worlds, the soil was either sterile, or already colonised by alien microbial life which couldn't break down Earth's plant residues left over after harvesting - making sustainable agriculture impossible until the soil could be re-colonised by Earth organisms.

A side-effect of Gaia's unexpected fecundity was a population explosion which, initially, went unnoticed by the union. On most worlds, new settlers immigrating from Earth greatly outnumbered native residents, but on Gaia it was the opposite.

Eventually, as the union sent officials and chartered companies to expand their operations on Gaia, they began to be viewed as unwelcome invaders colonising the native Gaians. This eventually culminated in Gaia secceeding from the union, which set of a chain reaction of other seccessions, and the breakdown.
