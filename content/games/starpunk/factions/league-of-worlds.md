# League of Worlds

An alliance of free worlds.

Comprises: Tartarus (former military settlement), and many other settlements.

The cost of membership is contributing to the upkeep of the League Navy, and the benefit of membership is receiving the protection of the League Navy.

## Formation

Many of the member states of the union sought true independence, and had no interest in escaping the union only to subordinate themselves to yet another government on some other planet.

While many worlds tried to go it alone in the immediate aftermath of the breakdown, they quickly found that defending themselves against the other remnants of the union was no easy task.

The League of Worlds was formed to provide mutual defense and support for these independent worlds, allowing them to pool resources and share the burden of defense.
