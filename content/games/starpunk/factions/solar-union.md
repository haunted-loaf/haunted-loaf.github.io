# Solar Union

An authoritarian republic.

Comprises: Earth, Luna, Mars, and some extra-solar settlements.

Nationalist hierarchy: Earth > Luna > Mars.

Extra-solar people and cultures viewed as enemy.

Society is mobilized for war. Political, civil, and economic freedoms curtailed in the interests of national cohesion.

## Ideology

Union policy states that the cause of the breakdown is native population growth in Arcadia and Gaia causing a disconnect in the national identity of union citizens.

## History

Since the breakdown, the union has adopted various policies intended to enhance national cohesion and reinforce the solar identity and culture.

The system of chartered territories has been abolished. Franchises and protectorates have been replaced with governates, overseen by republic-appointed governers with a mandate to ensure efforts are directed towards the interests of the republic.

Cantonments are under martial law, with non-military residents relocated to principals or governates. The SPSF has merged with planetside armed forces to form the Solar Defence Forces.

The union's focus is on reforming the Solar Union by regaining control of Arcadia, Gaia, and the former chartered territories - and securing the union's peaceful future by purging what it describes as "anti-Solar" elements.
