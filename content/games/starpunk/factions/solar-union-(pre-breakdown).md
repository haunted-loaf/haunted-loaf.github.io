# Solar Union (Pre-Breakdown)

A solar empire with trappings of liberal democracy. Not dissimilar to 1600s British Empire.

Comprises: Earth, Luna, Mars, Arcadia, and many extra-solar settlements.

Extra-solar settlements set up under union charters, either military, corporate, or community.

The pre-breakdown state. A confederation of Earth, Luna, Mars, Arcadia, and many smaller territories. The small territories were represented in the union by one of the five principal members.

The union's military, the Solar Peace and Security Force, served peacekeeping and police functions, primarily concerned with addressing smuggling and small- scale piracy. While principal members retained traditional armed forces, only the SPSF was authorized to operate a space force.

## Territories

Aside from the principal members, the union had three kinds of _chartered territories_:

- Franchises, administered by a corporation;
- Protectorates, self-administered by their residents; and
- Cantonments, military bases under SPSF jurisdiction.

Franchises were established under a union charter sponsored by a principal member. They typically ran as company towns, with the owning corporation providing everything residents needed to live. The charters granted corporations exclusive rights to provide certain goods and services within the franchise, so residents either had to work for the corporation or carefully avoid competing with it.

Protectorates could be established by private individuals or groups. While no law prohibited establishing independent settlements outside union jurisdiction, becoming a protectorate granted valuable benefits like SPSF protection and access to union finance and aid programs. Enrolment as a protectorate required a principal sponsor.

Cantonments were established by the union for exclusive SPSF use. They served as garrisons, ship yards, and naval bases. By law, the production and assembly of items dedicated to SPSF use was carried on inside cantonments, although these operations were contracted out to corporations under _concessionaire agreements_ similar to franchises. Although operated by and for the military, outside of military matters, the cantonments were under civil governance.

## Governance

The government of the union consisted of a directly-elected parliament and a council of the governments of each member state. Union law had to be approved by both the parliament and council to come into force. While each member was responsible for implementing union law in its own territory, a Solar Commission provided governance and administration for inter-state elements.

The Solar Union technically had no head of state, although the council had a president who was often treated as such. Similarly, the high commissioner of the solar commission was often regarded as the head of government.

The solar judiciary consisted of the court of justice, which heard cases between member states, and the court of appeals, which heard cases between individuals and member states.

The union's military, the Solar Peace and Security Force, served peacekeeping and police functions, primarily concerned with addressing smuggling and small- scale piracy. However, while member states were permitted traditional armed forces, only the SPSF was authorized to operate a space navy.

Member states could secede from the union. If a non-member settlement wished to secede, it would first have to become a member, which would be challenging.
