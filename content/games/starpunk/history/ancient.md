# History of the Galaxy

## Panspermia

Billions of years ago, life arose on an unidentified world. A presumably catastrophic event sent fragments of rock containing primitive lifeforms out of the world's star system and into the galaxy.

The nature of the seed, the "progenote", isn't precisely known, but it is known that it was a kind of ribocyte - a single-celled organism with no persistent internal structures using RNA to encode genetic data.

The same progenotes seeded life on many other worlds in the galactic neighbourhood. It is believed that in most cases, life did not survive very long, but on some worlds the seed took root and life survives to the present day.

### Alternative theories

Some believe the seed was not spread randomly after being ejected from its host system, but intentionally spread by space-faring aliens.

Some believe that panspermia did not occur, and the recurrence of RNA-based life is simply a result of convergent evolution.

Some believe that life was seeded on each planet by a deity. Most notable for holding this belief are the Mormons, who also maintain that we will eventually find planets with humanoid life.

Some believe that extraterrestrial life is a deception being perpetuated for mysterious reasons. These people generally believe that life currently exists on other worlds, but maintain that it was introduced recently by humans.

## Earth

Around 4 billion years ago, the progenote arrived on Earth
and seeded life there.
