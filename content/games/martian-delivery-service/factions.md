## Martian Confederation

A loose alliance of, primarily, homesteaders, the Martian
Confederation is a political movement that seeks to
establish a decentralised, self-governing Martian state.

## Martian Home Rule

A movement for Martian independence, the Martian Home Rule
movement seeks to establish a Martian state. Most MHR
advocates call for a strong centralised state, but there is
still much disagreement on the form it should take.

## Colonial Realism

A movement to maintain the status quo. Colonial Realism
seeks to keep Mars under the control of the Union of Earth.

## Movement for Planetary Union

A movement for a united Mars to join the Union of Earth as a
member state. This is a sort of hybrid of the Martian Home
Rule and Colonial movements. It has limited support, mostly
from Earthers.
