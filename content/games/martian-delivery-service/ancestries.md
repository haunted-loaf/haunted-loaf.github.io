# Ancestries

## Earthers

Some are on Mars for work, some for pleasure, some out of
necessitity. They regard Earth as their home, and Mars as
somewhere they happen to be.

## Martians

Most Martians were born on Mars, or have lived there for
decades. Some believe only native-born Martians are true
Martians, while others believe anyone can claim Mars as
their home.

## Lunars

People from the Moon. The Moon's proximity and dependence on
Earth enables Earth to keep it on a tight leash. Many
Martians view Lunars as essentially equivalent to Earthers,
while Earthers often position Lunars as model
extraterrestrial citizens, and compare Martians unfavourably
with them.
