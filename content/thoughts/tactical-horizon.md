# Tactical Horizons

One thing I love in game design is designing what I call "tactical horizons" - I don't know if there's another name for it.

It's the length, in time, that a gameplay decision affects the game. For example, in a game with regenerating health, the tactical horizon of taking damage extends until your health regenerates. In other games it might extend to finding potions, reaching a bonfire, or finishing the level. I think a good game has overlapping tactical horizons.

Some concrete examples from Death Stranding:

* When moving with your delivery in the world, you decide whether to walk or run. Running is faster, but requires extra gameplay to stay balanced. You can very quickly change your pace, so the horizon for this is in the seconds.

* You also choose where to go. If you go over rough terrain, you're more likely to fall over, but it may be a slightly faster route. The horizon for this may be tens of seconds or more.

* You can choose the route more generally. There may be a direct route which takes you through enemy territory, but a longer, safer, route. The horizon is several minutes.

* Before you start on a delivery, you decide how much stuff to take with you. If you overload yourself, it's more challenging to make the delivery, but you progress the game faster. This horizon might even extend for hours.

* You can choose to put resources into building roads, vehicles, or other ways to traverse the world more easily. Those resources are then unavailable for other improvements, and you had to expend time moving those resources around. The horizon could extend over multiple play sessions, even the entire game.
