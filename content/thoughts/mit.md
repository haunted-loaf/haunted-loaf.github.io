# MIT license misunderstanding

There is an incredibly common misunderstanding of the MIT
license as permitting one to take MIT licensed code and just
relicense it under different terms. This is _not
meaningfully true_.

The _original_ license applies to "any person obtaining a
copy of the Software". This means that without any action on
your part, if you distribute MIT-licensed software to other
people, the original license is _automatically_ extended to
them.

The attribution clause not only gives credit, but gives the
recipient notice that the MIT license applied to some of the
software they received.

People who receive the combine code from me are authorised
to modify or distribute whatever MIT-licensed code remains,
if they can unravel it from the whole.
